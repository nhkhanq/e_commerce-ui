# Deployment Guide - E-Commerce UI

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ Storage Access Errors Resolved

The application previously had storage access errors that prevented deployment:

- `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Access to storage is not allowed from this context`

**Solutions implemented:**

1. **Safe Storage Wrapper** (`src/lib/safe-storage.ts`)

   - Created `SafeStorage` class with try-catch blocks
   - Proper browser environment detection
   - Graceful fallbacks when storage is unavailable

2. **Updated All Storage Access Points**

   - All `localStorage` calls now use safe storage utilities
   - SSR-safe implementations
   - No more direct localStorage access

3. **Environment Detection** (`src/lib/env.ts`)
   - Safe browser/server environment detection
   - Storage availability checking
   - Safe console access

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

npm run build
# Exit code: 0
# 2796 modules transformed successfully
